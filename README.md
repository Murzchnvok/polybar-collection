# Polybar Collection

My personal collection. Trying to make some nice themes, and show how great [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) is. I'll keep updating the collection, and maybe create some custom scripts so you and I can have a better experience with this thing. I also recommend you to check this [adi1090x Polybar Collection](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), has some great themes, so if you don't like my collection, you can just check the other one. Also the reason why I'm doing this is because I want you to have more options and ideas to build your own theme.

## Getting Started
